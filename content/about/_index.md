Hi there. My name is David Harrigan.  I'm a software engineer from New
Hampshire.  Fun fact about me: I was born in Zushi, Japan and I am fluent in
both Japanese and English.  I also have abnormally strong toes.

I enjoy solving challenging problems and learning is my passion.  I am thrilled
to shared content that I find interesting, and I hope you find them useful and
exciting.  Thanks for stopping by!
