      <description>At my previous job, I came to appreciate the importance of integration testing. Not only does it give us confidence (especially when weâ€™re on-call), but it continuously verified that our services were functional through automated runs from Jenkins.
Two of the primary languages used at the time were Go and Python. Although the majority of our services were written in Go, most of our API tests were written in Python.</description>
